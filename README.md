# Burnout
A Quest Beat Saber plugin for tweaking various burn-mark parameters.

## Configuration:
* **Enable Tweaks:** Acts as a master switch for all custom settings.
* **Burn Lifetime:** Controls how long to keep the burn-marks on-screen.
* **Burn Opacity:** Determines the thickness/glowiness of burn trails.
* **Burn Scale:** The relative brush size of burn trails.
## Colors
The overriden saber colours are stored as hex values (e.g: #ffffff).
